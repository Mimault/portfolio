                <p class="text">
                    To realise this project over a period of 6 months, we were a team of 6 third-year students:
                    <br/> 3 designers and 3 developers.
                    <br/> Our efforts during the creative process focused on user experience. We sought to answer the problems posed by the management of volunteers in event planning. Eventually, the deliverables of our 3rd year project were presented to web professionals.

                <h2 class="titre_text">CREATION</h2>
                <p class="text">
                    To confirm the relevancy of our concept, we conducted a competitive intelligence research based on criteria relating to the problematic. We determined the target and the users that were illustrated by personas. Then we designed a logo and chose a first graphic charter from our respective mood boards.

                <h2 class="titre_text">DELIVERY MODELS AND CLICKSTREAM</h2>
                <p class="text">
                    We have developed several delivery models to effectively meet the user's needs. We then mapped the differents clickstreams. These patterns had an important impacts the design and architecture of the website.

                <p class="text">
                    After having studied all the functionalities relating to our critical clickstreams and to the delivery models of our user’s tasks, we graphically positioned the actions necessary for the functioning of the website. We have prioritized these interactions to identify 5 website versions, from the MVP to the Alpha version.

                <p class="text">
                    We designed the wireframes of each of our models. They derived from brainstorming sessions in which the entire team participated, so there were many proposals regarding the design of web pages. We went through several evolutions paced by the user tests (A / B testing). The results of these tests enabled the realization of mock-ups of the Beta version.
